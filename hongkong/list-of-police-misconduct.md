# List of Police Misconduct

This article will provide a list of police brutality and misconduct towards the Hong Kong protestors and press. The list will only show incidents where there is **indisputable video evidence of police misconduct**. While these videos are terrifying, it's important to remember that they only cover a small subset of the police brutality, as it's not possible to capture everything on video, especially inside the holding centers, where there has been numerous accusations of sexual assault and torture, including a teenage boy who claim he was sodomized and gang-raped. There has also been an unbelievably high number of suicides in recent months, and it has gotten so bad that the protestors yell their name upon arrest and declare that they have no intention of committing suicide.

Each incident has a GIF snippet along with a link to the full video. This is done to ensure the videos can be seen and shared by those living in China. If the GIF clips are taking too long to load, then you can click the 'See full video' links instead - by doing so then you will also be able to see the full video in a better resolution. It's strongly recommended to see the incidents taking place at 2019-08-31 and 2019-08-11.
