This VPN should last for a very long time, because there's no easy way for the Chinese government to block it without blocking Cloudflare along with the millions of other websites and services that use Cloudflare. It might even be more costly for the Chinese government to block Cloudflare than it would be to block GitHub, and it's only going to get worse as Cloudflare Workers become more mature and widespread.

If you use iOS then you might want to hurry to download the app, because Apple is likely to ban it from the Chinese App Store the moment the CCP tell them to do so. That being said, last I checked then there were nothing preventing you from selecting a different country when you register an App Store account. It is strongly recommended to choose any country except China when you register an App Store account, even if you are a Chinese citizen.
